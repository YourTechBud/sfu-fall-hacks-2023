[{"title":"Note 1","content":"Title: Teaching shadowing:\n\n\t- Send one invite for everyone with timing!\n\t- Start my casual interaction. Make them talk. Keep the conversations open ended.\n\t\t- Consider establishing a good getting-started routine which focusses on:\n\t\t\t- Freeing them up a bit\n\t\t\t- Raising the overall energy level\n\t\t\t- Set a good tone for the rest of the invite\n\t- Weave english & math questions:\n\t\t- How was your week? (Ask follow up costumes to make the conversation deeper)\n\t\t- How was your summer?\n\t\t- Did you go to Jamatkhana?\n\t- Regularly ask how was school\n\t\t- What they are doing in school\n\t\t- Any homework?\n\t- Go straight to screen sharing from here\n\t\t- Resources:\n\t\t\t- IXL (Always touch this. Good for assessments)\n\t\t\t- K5Learning (Good for additional training material)\n\t\t\t- pictures for a google search\n\t\t- Decide what you wanna go through in the session before the session itself\n\t- Questioning round: Keep un-sharing during this\n\t\t- Make them work their memory\n\t\t- Watch their body language\n\t\t- Might have to share again to jog their memory\n\t\t- Interweave the questioning in their daily life. So make them relate the content personally. This generates some good homework ideas (especially when they are new to such things)\n\t- Make them write stuff:\n\t\t- Make sure they write what they need help in\n\t\t- Writing is good to engage more of the brain\n\t\t- Stuff like spellings\n\t- Have a reward system on milestones (like getting 3 right in a row)\n\t\t- Like a small solute\n\t- Make personal notes based on interactions which you can follow up on.\n\t\t- Find addional resources on k5learning\n\t\t- For math, researching on techniques will help\n\t- Questions I need to follow up on:\n\t\t- How do i send the invites? Single or multiple\n\t\t- Does ixl assignments update the diagnostics","action_items":"\n**Send out invitations**: Schedule and send out invitations for the teaching sessions using the appropriate platform. Ensure all participants receive the invitation and are aware of the meeting time.\n\n**Prepare for the session**: Before each session, prepare by reviewing the student's progress, gathering necessary materials, and deciding on the topics to be covered. Familiarize yourself with any recent developments in the students' lives so that you can incorporate these into the lessons.\n\n**Start with casual interaction**: Begin each session with informal chatting to create a comfortable atmosphere. Ask open-ended questions about their week, summer activities, and school experiences. Encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings.\n\n**Integrate English and Math questions**: Incorporate both subject areas into the discussions to keep the students engaged. Use questions related to their daily life to encourage personal connections with the subjects being taught.\n\n**Screen Sharing and Resource Utilization**: Once the initial discussion has been completed, proceed with screen sharing and use educational resources such as IXL, K5 Learning, and Google searches to teach concepts effectively. Choose the resources wisely and decide on the content to cover beforehand.\n\n**Questioning Round**: Engage the students in a question-answer round where they are encouraged to recall information independently. Observe their body language and provide assistance if needed. Connect the content to their everyday life to enhance understanding and generate interesting homework ideas.\n\n**Writing Exercises**: Encourage students to write down their difficulties and learning points. Writing helps engage more parts of the brain and improves retention. Focus on spelling practice whenever possible.\n\n**Reward System**: Implement a rewards system for achieving milestones, such as completing three problems correctly in a row. Offer small treats as incentives to motivate the students.\n\n**Personal Notes**: Take detailed notes after each session, including observations, questions raised, and additional resources found on K5 Learning. These notes will serve as valuable references for future sessions and allow you to tailor your approach accordingly.\n\n**Questions to Follow Up On**: Clarify doubts about sending invitations (single or multiple), and whether completing IXL assignments updates diagnostic reports. Research and implement effective math techniques to improve teaching quality."}]
